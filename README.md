# GAME TITLE

### High Concept


Iron Casket is a single player third person mech shooter game, 
where the player pilots a heavily armed bi-pedal robotic war machine 
in a daring one man raid on a government military controlled city, 
and the arms depot constructed at its core. Players are rewarded 
just for playing via the large array of destruction related effects 
given for them to play with, such as giant explosions when destroying 
enemy mechs, arms and legs being torn off in a hail of bullets, 
and buildings that collapse dynamically when severely damaged. 
Take control, destroy all enemy mechs that stand in your path, 
and demolish anything that gets in your way.
